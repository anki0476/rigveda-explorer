  "text": "Welcome to the Deep Dive. Today, we're doing something pretty special. We're not just, you know, talking about ancient history. We are stepping right through the front door of maybe the oldest surviving book humanity has the Rigveda. That's right. And our focus is Mandala One. Think of it as the what the grand entrance hall. It sets everything up. Millennium thinking, spirituality. Yeah. It starts here. It really does. And it's huge. This Mandala One or M one, as you called it. It's kind of the foundation. It is. And tackling something this ancient. It's a big task. But M one, it's almost designed as the entryway. It gives you the the essential blueprint, Vedic cosmology, ritual, early philosophy. It's all packed in there. So we're going to unpack it using the sources looking at what seven key themes woven through it. There are seven threads in this massive ancient tapestry. Okay. And here's the kicker. The thing that just grabs you immediately. If you look right at the beginning, the very, very first word of the entire Rigveda. Why? It's just one word. Gone. Agini. Fire. Fire. Just. And that single word tells you so much. It's incredibly deliberate. Agni isn't just, you know, flames and heat. No. No. The Rigveda right from its first breath is saying the connection between humans and the divine. It's active. It's participatory. Agni is that connection. The bridge. The sacred bridge. Precisely. The messenger. The one who takes our offerings, our prayers from right here on earth and carries them up directly to the gods and the heavens. Wow. Okay. So starting with Agni establishes that ritual connection right away. Absolutely. It's non-negotiable. Right. So that's our starting point. The sacred bridge. And our mission today, it's pretty ambitious. We're going through this whole mandala from Agni's first flame, then Indra's thunder. Right. Freeing the water. Cosmic battle. Yes. Then tackling those really complex riddle hands. Largatamas' puzzles. Deep stuff. Mapping out Vishnu's three strides that cosmic reach. Cosmo pervasion. And crucially, we have to talk about the women's voices. Yeah. The Rishis, the female seers whose words are right there in the text. Absolutely essential. Their inclusion is so okay. Yeah. Let's open that door. 3500 years of memory kept alive and sound. Ready? Let's dive in. All right. First things first. Let's just get a handle on the size of this thing. Mandala one. It's well, it's huge. Monumental is the word. We're topping 191 hymns. 191. Okay. And that breaks down into 2006 versus just raw numbers. It's the largest single mandala in the entire rigveta. 2000 versus wow. And that scale, it connects directly to something scholars find, well, really fascinating about its structure. Oh, cheers. Which is that mandala one, even though it's book number one, it's actually not the oldest part of the rigveta. We really, that seems counter intuitive. Book one isn't the first stuff written. Exactly. It's a structural twist that makes you rethink how these ancient texts were put together. Okay. Explain that. Why number eight one? If it's not chronologically first. Because it seems M1 was compiled later, the real core, the oldest layer of the rigveta, that's actually found in mandala's two through seven. Two through seven. Yeah. Those are often called the family books. Family books. Because they were composed and passed down within specific priestly families, specific lineages of rishis, you know, the gritsamadas, the bishvamicha, the sichhas. Each family had its collection probably from an earlier tighter time frame. Okay, so those are older, more specific collections. Right. Mandala one, on the other hand, looks like it was deliberately put together later. Maybe as a kind of grand introduction, a comprehensive overview. Like a greatest hits or a master anthology to start things off. That's a good way to think about it. An anthology, yeah. It wasn't aiming to be the earliest, but maybe the most essential starting point. Giving the listener or the student the full scope of the tradition before they dive into those specific family books. Like walking into a museum, and the first big hall gives you highlights from every wing. Exactly. That's a great analogy. And because it was compiled like that, M1 is layered. It contains hymns from different eras, some are really archaic, foundational. Others are later compositions reflecting, you know, how the tradition evolved over centuries. So the book itself is like time captured in poetry. In a way, yes, time inverse. It brings together different styles, different perspectives. You hear this whole assembly of important voices. People like Madaganda, who wrote the very first hymn, then Medatithi, Sunashepa, and Durgatama, who we'll talk about later, the really philosophical one. It helps to ground it though. Knowing this isn't just abstract poetry floating in space, the sources connected to a real place, right? Very clearly. The geography described the way settlements are mentioned, the events. It matches up remarkably well with the historical landscape. We're talking early settlements along the Saraswati and Dhrashadvati rivers. We have dates for that. The archaeological and linguistic evidence points pretty strongly to the period between, say, 1,500 and 1,200 BC. So, 3,500 years ago, roughly? Give or take. And that context is vital. You need to appreciate the reality behind the verses. This was a specific culture, in a specific place, codifying their entire history, their view of the cosmos, their identity through this poetry. These hymns were like memory maps. Perfectly preserved memory maps, yes. Defining who they were, how they're related to the universe. So M1 serves as this ultimate prologue, historical, cosmological, and it throws us straight into the most essential element. Fire. Agni. Okay, let's do that. Let's move from the structure to the content. Starting with that very first word, Agni, the sacred bridge. Right. It's him 1.1, the very beginning, composed by Madhachanda and the opening lines. They just hit you. Agni mi hitam ganyasya devan pudh ficham. I praise Agni, the household priest, the divine efficient, even the sound if it feels deliberate, powerful. It is. And notice right away, Agni isn't just fire. He's a person, a conscious entity, a divine being, and the verse immediately gives him two very specific, crucial jobs, ritual roles. Roles within the edge of the sacrifice. Exactly. These roles are central to the whole Vedic system. Let's break those down because they really define what fire meant to the society spiritually and socially. Okay, first role. Pudohita. Pudohita. What does that mean? Literally, it means placed in front. But in practice, it meant the household priest, the chief priest of a king or a community, but also the sacred fire at the heart of the home. So a stabilizing force? Absolutely. The pure heat of fire was meant to be kept burning constantly. It was the sacred center of family life. It watched over everything continuity, purity, stability for the family, the whole community. It wasn't just about ritual. The human pure heat was often a key advisor, maintaining balance. Agni embodies that stabilizing presence in the home. Okay, placed in front, the household priest and the second role. The fee. Good fee. This is more the specialized ritual efficient. The priest who knows the exact procedures for the big, complex sacrifices, the timing, the formulas, everything has to be perfect. And Agni is that expert. Agni as the fees is the expert conduit. When you pour your offering, maybe ghee, clarified butter or the sacred soma drink into the flames. Yeah. Agni consumes it, transforms it. The smoke carries the essence of the offering straight up to whichever god you're addressing. He's the reliable delivery system. So he's the home's anchor, the messenger, the ritual expert. Even the one bringing gifts from the gods back sometimes. Yes, the giver of gifts too. And the beauty is the symbolism comes directly from watching fire itself. It's so immediate, so physical. Also, we'll think about it. You see smoke rising. That's not just smoke, right? In their view, that's the visible proof of your prayer, your offering, traveling upwards to the heavens. Ah, okay. The physical journey. And the flames leaping up from the altar. Quick, hungry flames. That's like divine speech. It's the gods responding, acknowledging, yes, we heard you. Agni is the communication network, the cosmic hotline. Right. No wonder he's in vote so often then. He's saying 189 verses just in M one, 189 verses, specifically calling on Agni in this one mandala alone. He's everywhere. But the really deep philosophical insight here that your sources point out is how they saw all fire as Agni, meaning the fire you carefully maintain in your home, hearth. That's the terrifying flash of lightning in a storm. Also Agni, the immense life giving fire of the sun. Agni again, even a sudden chaotic forest fire. Still a manifestation of Agni. So different forms, but the same underlying divine force. Exactly. It's this fascinating concept scholars sometimes call monotheistic unity inside polytheism. They saw the one divine essence, showing itself in all these different powerful ways in the world. It's an early, profound attempt to unify the diverse, sometimes scary forces of nature under one understandable, relatable sacred principle. And to really cement this foundational idea, Muthachanda, the composer, used a very specific rhythm for this first hymn. The most sacred rhythm, yes, it's composed in the Gayatri meter. Gayatri, that sounds familiar. It should. It's the same meter. Three lines, eight syllables each, so three by eight as the universally famous Gayatri mantra from later Hinduism. Well, so using that meter right at the start of the entire Rigveda. It instantly signals this text as eternal foundational sacred. The rhythm itself feels perfect, controlled, stable. Just like Agni's role as the purehita, the stabilizer, it locks it in from the very first sound. Okay. So from that stable unifying fire, we now need to shift to something much more dynamic, explosive even, the power needed to keep the cosmos going. We shift to the storm, to the great god Indra. Right. Him 1.32, this feels like a total change of pace. We're moving into epic narrative territory now. Completely. This hymn tells arguably the most famous, most celebrated story in the entire Rigveda. It's the great cosmic clash, Indra versus Ritra. The ultimate good versus evil kind of story. Well, maybe more like order versus chaos. Ritra is this massive serpent, or sometimes described as a dragon-like figure, and he's done something terrible. What's that? He's coiled himself around the primordial waters, trapped them inside a mountain, or maybe underground. Basically, he's holding back the life-giving rivers. Closing drought. Steps. Exactly. Wide spread, drought, famine. The world is suffocating under his grip. He is the obstacle. The restrainer. That's what Ritra means. And Indra is the hero who steps up. Indra is the quintessential Vedic warrior god. He takes on the task of liberation, and he has this amazing weapon. The Vajra. The Vajra, yes. The Thunderbolt. Forged for him by twat, the divine craftsman. It's his signature weapon. And he uses it too. He smashes Ritra, or sometimes the image is cleaving open the mountain where the waters are trapped. With this immense, thunderous power, he shatters the obstruction. And the waters are freed. The river's burst forth. Life returns to the land. It's the mythic explanation for the monsoon, the return of the rains after the dry season, a cosmic victory over sterility and death. Okay, but here's where it gets interesting. Like you mentioned with Agni, the details matter. The sources stress something about the language. The plural. Yes, this is crucial. Often the text doesn't just say Indra struck Ritra. It says Indra struck the Vretras. Plural. The Vretras. What does that imply? It opens up the meaning hugely. If it were just singular Vretra, you could read it as one specific monster, one specific drought event that happened once. A single cosmic enemy. But plural. Plural suggests Vretra isn't just one thing. Vretra becomes a category of obstacle. Maybe it represents all drought, or all forces that hold back life and prosperity. Or it could mean multiple enemies. Multiple enemies like human enemies. That's where the interpretation gets really layered. Could striking the Vretras also be a coded reference to historical battles? Conflicts that early Vedic people had with other groups, maybe non-Vetip tribes or rivals in that Saraswati River region, perhaps people who were literally blocking access to water sources or seen as obstacles to Vedic expansion in way of life. So the myth works on two levels at once. At least two. That's the brilliance of it. On one level, it's absolutely meteorological cosmic. Vretra is the drought. Indra's victory is the life giving monsoon. It's a cycle that repeats every year. Essential for survival. The myth explains and celebrates that natural cycle. On another level. On another level, socio-historically, invoking Indra smashing the Vretras could absolutely have reinforced the Vedic people's sense of identity. They're right to the land. They're dominance over rivals. It links their own victories, their own struggles directly to this necessary cosmic battle. Both meanings live inside the hymn. And it doesn't stop there, does it? There's an internal meaning too. Yes, the psychological dimension. Just like Agni connects the outer ritual to interstate, Indra and Vretra play out inside us too. How so? Vretra, the obstructor, can represent our own internal barriers. Fear, doubt, ignorance, procrastination, anything that blocks our own flow, our potential, our creativity, our wisdom. Indra. Indra becomes the force within us needed to break through. Courage, decisive action, insight, the will to overcome those internal vretras. So every time you face down a fear or push through a mental block, that's an echo of Indra's cosmic battle. So even a thunderstorm takes on a deeper meaning. Every storm becomes a reminder of this cosmic and internal struggle and potential victory. And naturally, this kind of high energy world-shaking battle needs a different rhythm than the stable Gayatri meter used for Agni. Definitely. This is heroic poetry, epic action. It calls for the triok meter four lines this time, each with 11 syllables. So four by 11, compare that to Gayatri's type three by eight. It's longer, more expansive. Exactly. It gives the poet more room in each line. It has this inherent forward momentum, a driving quality, perfect for describing Indra's charge, the power of the Vajra, the shattering of mountains, the release of the waters. It sounds like heroic action. Okay. From the clash of thunder and the breaking of obstacles, we now pivot again to something quieter, but maybe even more challenging. The realm of the mind. We move to the riddle him to the seeds of philosophy. All right, him 1.164. This one feels different, almost like a detour. It is quite unique within the Rigveda, especially within Mandala one. Its main purpose isn't really invoking a god for help or telling a mythic story. Its purpose is thinking, philosophical exploration. And it's associated with this specific Rishi. Yes, the composer is named as Durukatamis, a very highly regarded, perhaps somewhat mysterious figure, and the him itself is basically a collection of riddles, 52 versus 52 deep complex puzzles about the nature of reality. 52 puzzles. Wow. So this is where M1 really leans into the intellectual side. It's moving from what people do in ritual to what they think. That's a perfect way to put it. It marks a subtle but significant shift. From ritual action, karma towards reflective knowledge, jhana, and it contains one image, one riddle that is echoed down through millennia of Indian thought. It's probably the most famous verse from this him. Which one is that? The one about the two birds. Two birds, companions, always together clinging to the self-same tree. Of these two, one eats the sweet fruit, the other looks on without eating. Two birds on one tree. One eats one watches. It's this incredibly concise metaphor for the duality of existence, particularly our own conscious existence. Let's unpack that duality. It sounds fundamental. It is. The interpretation that became standard, especially later, is this. The tree. That's the body. Or maybe the entire material world, the world of change and experience. Okay. And the two birds. They represent two aspects of the self. The bird that eats the fruit, that's the jiva. The individual soul, your personal self, the one experiencing life. It eats the fruits, the consequences of actions, the karma. It feels the pleasure, the pain, the sweetness, the bitterness. It's caught up in the drama of living. Okay. The jiva, the individual experiencer, and the other bird, the one just watching. That bird represents the atman, the higher self, the supreme self, the universal consciousness. It's present, it's aware, but it remains detached. It simply witnesses the jiva's experiences without getting entangled. It doesn't eat the fruit because it knows it's separate from the actions and their results. It's the unchanging eternal witness. Wow. That's incredibly deep. The experiencer and the witness within each of us. It's profound. And the crucial thing for understanding the history of ideas is that this exact image, the specific verse, it doesn't just disappear after the Rigveda. It reappears almost word-for-word centuries later in the Upanishads. You punish odds. The core philosophical text. Exactly. This riddle from Durek Atama has become a foundational teaching in Vedanta philosophy. It shows that the deepest questions about self-consciousness, reality, the very seeds of that intense philosophical inquiry were already present right here embedded in this ancient riddle hymn in the Rigveda. That's amazing. So it's not like philosophy suddenly appeared later. The roots go right back here. The roots are undeniably here. It's an astonishing continuity of thought. Does this hymn tackle other big questions too? Besides the two birds. Oh yes, it's packed. There are verses puzzling over the mystery of speech. Where does it come from? What's its ultimate source? Riddles about the nature of time, the cycles of the sun and moon, the cosmic order. And significantly, it contains an early mention of Vishnu's three strides, which we'll get to next. So it's really a turning point. The moment the Rigveda starts explicitly asking why? And what is not just please help or we praise you? Precisely. It signals that shift. The recognition that true understanding requires more than just performing the ritual correctly. It requires deep rigorous contemplation, thinking hard. Okay, so this hymn, full of questions, even mentions Vishnu. Let's follow that thread. Let's look at Vishnu's role in mapping out the cosmos. All right. So building on that mention in the riddle hymn, we turn to him 1.154, which is specifically dedicated to Vishnu. And it celebrates his most characteristic, most defining act in the Rigveda. The three steps. The three strides. Yes, the key line goes something like, Vietrmerdi, Kakram, Favim, Eytam, Trathani, Dahipa, them. Basically, Vishnu strode out over this earth three times he planted his footstep. He measured out the entire universe with just three steps. And those three steps cover specific realms, right? Yes, the traditional understanding is clear. The first step covers the earth, our world. The second step covers the atmosphere, the mid region, the sky. And the third step reaches the highest heaven, the realm of the gods, the ultimate reality. So he's literally encompassing and defining all of existence, establishing the cosmic map. Exactly. He's the measure of reality. His steps establish order, stability, and the very dimensions of the universe. It's an act of cosmic structuring. Now, before we dig into what this means, you mentioned the sources suggest pausing here, taking a breath. Yes, I think it's important because we're talking about ideas that are 3500 years old you listening right now need to try and connect with the weight of that. How so? Imagine it. Picture yourself standing on the banks of the Saraswati River. It's maybe dawn, maybe dusk. There's a fire burning nearby Agni. Maybe you hear thunder in the distance Indra. And then you hear the Rishi chanting these very words about Vishnu's three steps. Mapping the cosmos with sound. Exactly. This isn't just old literature in a book. For millennia, it was living memory. The structure of the universe, the relationship with the divine, preserved perfectly. Note for note, syllable by syllable, purely through sound, passed down through generations. Feel the weight of that unbroken chain reaching you right now. Okay, holding that feeling. Let's talk about this rigvetic Vishnu. Because the source to say he's quite different from the Vishnu many people might know from later stories. That's a crucial distinction. When people think of Vishnu today, they often think of his avatars, right? Like Rama or Krishna or even the Vama Avatar, the dwarf, who takes three steps to trick the demon king, Bali. Right. The story where he asks for just three pieces of land and then grows huge to cover everything. Exactly. But the rigvetic Vishnu, in him, 1.154, it's generally seen as less about that specific narrative, that kind of trickster intervention. It's more abstract, more fundamental. Oh, so more abstract. Here, his three steps aren't really about defeating a demon. They're about cosmic pervasion, infinity. He represents the underlying presence that permeates everything that makes space itself possible. He's vast, subtle, the foundation upon which everything else rests. So less of an active hero figure, more of a fundamental principle of reality, like the space that allows everything else to happen. That's a very good way to put it. He establishes the reliable boundaries, the order. He ensures the cycles of day and night, the stability of the realms. He is stability, the unchanging background. He represents universal presence, not so much dramatic action like Indra. And speaking of Indra, they often appear together, don't they? Very frequently, yes. They're often invoked as a pair, Indra Vishnu. And it makes perfect sense when you think about their complementary roles. How do they complement each other? Indra brings the dynamic force, the power, the energy, the intervention needed to smash obstacles like retra to overcome immediate threats, whether cosmic or internal. He's the action hero. And Vishnu. Vishnu provides the stability after the action. He represents the vastness, the permanence, the pervasive order that ensures the victory lasts. At the cosmos holds together. Indra wins the battle. Vishnu secures the kingdom, power and probation, energy and stability. It's a beautifully balanced divine system. Wow. Okay. So from that vast cosmic architecture, laid out by Vishnu and defended by Indra, let's zoom back in. Right down to the human level, to the household. Yeah. And to a conversation that includes a remarkably strong female voice. Yes. Let's talk about Lopamutra. Okay. Him 1.179. This one is structured differently, again, isn't it? It's not an invocation, not a riddle. No, it's presented as a dialogue, a direct, quite intimate conversation between two figures, the famous Rishi Agastya and his wife Lopamutra. A husband or wife talking preserved in the Rigveda. Exactly. And it captures this moment of, well, marital and spiritual tension. What's the tension about? It seems Agastya was deeply committed to austerity, asceticism, maybe neglecting his duties as a husband and householder and pursuit of spiritual goals, perhaps for a very long time. Like he was focusing only on renunciation. Pretty much. And Lopamutra is the one who speaks up. She challenges him. She's the proactive voice in this him. What does she say? She basically reminds some of the need for balance. The key line attributed to her goes something like, for many years have I served you diligently through nights and dawns, aging me. Old age impairs the beauty of limbs. Let husbands now approach their wives or a shorter version often quoted. We've grown old and austerity now fulfilled the householders duty too. Wow. She's calling him back to their life together to the responsibilities of marriage of family. Precisely. She's arguing essentially that the path of the Gathasa, the householder, involved in family life, producing children, maintaining the lineage is just as important, just as much divine duty as the path of the renunciate, the Sanyasi. You can't just have one without the other for a complete life or a complete society. And the really significant point here that the source is emphasized is that a Gosti listens. He listens. The dialogue ends with a Gosti acknowledging her wisdom and well fulfilling his duties. The very fact that this conversation was preserved included in Mandala one alongside Hens to the Great Gods tells you how much value the tradition placed on her insight. Her wisdom was honored. That feels pretty radical for a text from what 1500 BCE. It is radical and it's not an isolated case. This is the crucial sociological point. The Rigveda explicitly names and include compositions or insights attributed to women's seers, female rishis known as rishikas. Like Lopamudra. Who else? Others mentioned include Gosha, Apala. Their voices, their perspectives were considered important enough, authoritative enough to be woven into the most sacred text. It suggests that early Vedic society or at least the intellectual circles compiling the Vedas was perhaps more complex, more open, more valuing a female wisdom than later periods might lead us to believe. So including this dialogue isn't just about a gastia and Lopamudra's personal story. It's making a broader statement. It absolutely is. It validates the householder stage of life. It argues for balance between worldly duties and spiritual pursuits. It shows that true spiritual life isn't just about renouncing the world but engaging with it wisely responsibly. And it honors a woman's role in articulating that wisdom. So Mandala one isn't just a doorway to the cosmos. It's also a mirror reflecting these really interesting social dynamics. The value placed on balance, on partnership, even across genders. I'm even reflecting a complex reality, yes. And the fact that we have this conversation, the specific human interaction preserved, it brings us to the final absolutely mind blowing point. How on earth was any this preserved? All 2006 versus for so long. Ah yes. The final wonder, the miracle of the oral tradition. Okay, this is the part that always just stuns me. We've talked about the depth, the philosophy, the cosmology, Mandala one, but the way it survived. It's perhaps the most astonishing part of the entire story. Here's the fact for the first 2000 years, maybe even longer of its existence. The rigzeta was never written down. Never written down. Just say that again, to millennia. At least this immense text, 191 hins, 2006 versus complex meters, subtle variations in tone and accent that were crucial for the ritual's effectiveness. All of it was transmitted purely through human memory. From teacher to student generation after generation. An unbroken chain. It's widely considered the most sophisticated, most accurate, large-scale, oral tradition known in human history. How is that even possible? I mean, think about playing the telephone game across the room, let alone across centuries. How do they prevent errors? They developed incredibly rigorous systematic methods. It wasn't just rope memorization, it involved complex techniques for chanting, checking, and cross-checking. Look what kind of techniques. Well, there were different pathas or recitation styles. The basic one was just reciting it straight through the Semhidipatha. But to ensure accuracy, they used others like the Kremapatha, the steppath. Yeah, where you'd link each word to the one before and the one after. So you'd recite word one, word two, then word two, word three, then word three, word four, and so on through the entire verse. It forces you to focus on the connection between each word. Okay, that sounds intensive. It is. And there were even more complex methods. Like the Jada Patha, the Woven Path, which involved reciting pairs of words forwards, then backwards, then forwards again in specific patterns. For example, one two two one one two then two three three three two three. It sounds incredibly complicated. Sounds like mental gymnastics. It was mental gymnastics, but it was designed precisely to catch any tiny error, a mispronounce syllable, a wrong accent, a skipped word. Neuroscientists today looking at these techniques are amazed. They essentially built systems that hardwired the text into the brain's memory networks with astonishing fidelity. So the result was? The result as your sources note was effectively zero typos. For maybe 3000 years, this massive text was preserved with near-perfect accuracy. It's a testament to the power of disciplined human memory. Wow. More reliable than early manuscripts, we could have scribal errors or decay. In many ways, yes. The living human mind trained in these methods became the ultimate high fidelity archive. And that connects back to Mendelsohn's legacy today. Absolutely. It wasn't just passively recorded. It was actively lived, kept alive and sound, in breath and memory. That's why M1, this grand prologue, still feels so potent. It's the enduring doorway because it speaks of things that are still fundamental. Firestorms. Riddles, the search for balance, the idea of infinity. These themes woven into M1 are still part of our daily experience or inner lives. The doorway opens 3500 years ago is still open. Hashtag Outroway. So wrapping up this deep dive into a Mandela one, it really is this monumental achievement that carefully constructed gateway. A master anthology, yep, designed to introduce you to the whole Vedic world. It establishes Agni's crucial role right at the start. It lays out the cosmic drama of Indra and Vritra. It plants those incredibly deep seeds of philosophy with the riddle him, pointing towards the Upanishads. It maps the cosmos with Vishnu's strides, emphasizing that pervasive stability. And so importantly, it preserved those powerful radical voices of women like Lopamudra, affirming balance and lived experience. It's a doorway but also a mirror reflecting cosmology, philosophy, social dynamics. All packed into this opening book, but remember it is just the introduction. All right, so where do we go next? Next time we step further inside, we'll move into Mandela 2. This is one of the core family books, specifically linked to the Gritsamata family of Rishis. We'll see how they develop the hymns to Agni and Indra in their own distinct intense style. Okay, looking forward to that. But for now as we close out our exploration of Mandela 1, maybe a final thought for everyone listening. Just this. The next time you see fire, whether it's a candle, a campfire, or just the pilot light on your stove, try to remember Agni, the messenger, the pureoheda. Or when you hear thunder rolling in. Think of Indra's Vajra smashing the obstacles internal or external, when dawn breaks. Think of the cosmic order Vishnu established. The point is Mandela 1 isn't locked away in the past. It's not just ancient history. No, it's a living map of reality. Its echoes are in the elements around you, in the questions you asked yourself. It was preserved in sound and it's still waiting for you to listen. Thank you for joining us on The Deep Jive.",
