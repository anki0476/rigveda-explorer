  "text": "Welcome back to The Deep Dive. Today we're cracking open, well, one of the oldest and most foundational scriptures of India, the Rigveda. Indeed. And not just the Rigveda generally, but we're focusing on a very specific part. Exactly. We're diving deep into Mandala 7. It's a section scholars often call quite beautifully the jewel of the Veda. That's right. And it's earned that title. This Mandala, it's really the emotional core you could say. And the hook for us today, the thing that grabs you immediately is a prayer within this section, souped as 7.86. Ah, yes. A prayer so raw, so deeply human. It's had to have made people weep for, well, 3000 years. 3000 years. Just think about that emotional power enduring across millennia and the author. None other than Vesitita, one of the legendary Saptari Shis, the seven great Sears, truly one of the wisest figures in the tradition. Which immediately presents us with a puzzle, doesn't it? It really does. If he's this pinnacle of wisdom, this enlightened sage. Why the tears? Why is he begging for forgiveness? And who is he begging forgiveness from? It's Varuna, the God of cosmic order. Not exactly the God you dissociate with easy pardons. Precisely. Varuna is the watcher, the upholder of Ata, the universal law. So the big question for us is, what kind of confession is this? What could possibly weigh so heavily on such a revered sage? Okay, so that's our mission for this deep dive. We're going to explore Vesitita's fully. We'll look at the history, the actual geography, the surprising archaeological links. Right. And the epic rivalry that defined an era, this clash between spiritual power and military might. We'll also delve into that profound prayer, the weight of, you know, unseen sin. And we'll even find the earliest hints of later philosophy, these first whispers of Advaita Fadonta. Plus a bit of unexpected humor along the way. Absolutely. Yeah. Him that's, well, surprisingly funny. So let's get started. Mandala seven. So Mandala seven, it's often called the family book of Vesitita, isn't it? That's a great way to put it. Unlike other Mandols that compile hymns from various sources, this one feels very much like the chronicle of a specific lineage, his lineage. And these roots aren't just metaphorical. They're tied to actual places. Very much so. The texts tie Vesitita's family, his whole tradition directly to the Saraswati river, their identity, their knowledge. It literally flowed like the river itself. It's fascinating how often we think of these texts as purely mythical, but there's real world geography underpinning them. Oh, absolutely. And it's not just vague geography. It's backed by archaeology now. Really? How so? Well, the period these hymns belong to roughly 1500 down to maybe 1200 BCE aligns with evidence of significant thriving settlements along the Saraswati and the nearby Dreshadvati rivers. So when Vesitita mentions his home, his community, he's talking about real places, excavations, you know, it's like like Raki Garhi, Kalangan. They show these large organized settlements, the descriptions of prosperity in the hymns. They match the archaeological picture of life along these fertile river banks. They're grounded so much more. It's not just abstract poetry, it's tied to a lived reality. Exactly. It's history woven into verse. And speaking of that reality, the central element, the Saraswati river itself, underwent this dramatic tragic change. It did. And that change is crucial to understanding its legity. Initially, the hymns praised its physical power, hymns 7.95, 7.96. They call her mighty among rivers, pure in her course. She was life-giving water. But then she dried up. Right. Geological changes, climate shifts. The exact reasons are debated. But the river dwindled and eventually disappeared in many stretches, a catastrophe for the people who depended on her. What happens then when the source of life literally vanishes? Something remarkable, a kind of poetic evolution, you could say. The memory of the river, its life-giving power, its purity, its flow, it was transformed into the concept of wisdom, of knowledge, of speech itself. The physical river died, but its essence was abstracted and elevated. Saraswati became the goddess of learning, a vach, the sacred word. So the loss of the physical led to the birth of the metaphysical goddess we know today? Precisely. What was lost in matter endured in meaning. That's why she still invoked so powerfully in education and the arts. It's an amazing example of cultural resilience. And Vaseesda was right there on the banks of this changing river. He wasn't just a poet in isolation. Not at all. He ran a major ashram, center of learning. He was a teacher, a guru, whose influence reached the highest levels of society. Including royalty. Yes, crucially, he was the royal preceptor, the guru to the Ikshvakudinastya of Ayotya. Tradition connects him directly to teaching Rama, the hero of the Ramayana. So when we read these hymns, we're hearing the voice, or at least the tradition, that shaped one of epic literature's greatest heroes. Exactly. It connects the ritual, the history, and the moral teachings in a very powerful way. It adds weight to every word. Okay, so from the relatively peaceful river banks and ashrams, we pivot to conflict. High drama, even a sage like Vaseesda had a major rival. Indeed, Vishva Mitra. And this wasn't just a minor disagreement. It was a clash that tested the very foundations of power in that world. How did it start? The sources give quite a specific incident, right? They do. It begins with Vishva Mitra, who at the time was a powerful king, a warrior king, visiting Vichras as hermitage. A royal visit. Sounds peaceful enough. It should have been. But Vishva Mitra sees Khmat Hanoo, the mythical wish-granting cow that miraculously provides for the entire hermitage. And well, being a king. You wanted it. He demanded it. He expected to take whatever he desired. But Vashisda refused. Flat out refused the king. Bull move. Refusing a king like Vishva Mitra. That's basically a declaration of war. And that's exactly how Vishva Mitra took it. He responded with overwhelming force. He merged his entire army cavalry, chariots, the works against this small seemingly defenseless hermitage. It sounds like a foregone conclusion. Military might versus, well, a sage in his students. It should have been instant annihilation. But this is where the story takes a profound turn. Vishisda didn't fight with weapons. What did he use? He stood his ground, armed only with tapas. Explain tapas again. It's not just sitting quietly, is it? No, no. It's far more potent than that. Think of it as concentrated spiritual energy, an inner fire built up through years, decades of intense discipline, austerity, meditation. It's focused psychic power. And he unleashed this tapas on an army. Yes. And the texts across various accounts describe the utter destruction of Vishva Mitra's forces. Not necessarily by physical means like a storm or earthquake. But how then? It's often described as a kind of overwhelming spiritual or psychic force. Maybe paralyzing fear, maybe their own weapons turning against them, maybe a wave of energy that just consumed their will to fight. The specifics vary, but the result is consistent. The army was routed, destroyed by spiritual power alone. That's incredible. The message is crystal clear. Absolutely. Spiritual strength, tapas, demonstrably trumped brute military force. It established a principle that inner power, wisdom, moral authority could be, and in this case was superior to worldly power. It's a foundational moment in Indian thought about kingship and spiritual authority. And what happened to Vishva Mitra? He wasn't killed obviously. No. He was utterly humbled. This defeat was so profound, so complete that it triggered a total life change. He realized his royal power was meaningless compared to Vesishta's tapas. He gave up his kingdom, renounced his throne, his wealth, his army, everything, and dedicated himself to achieving the same spiritual status to becoming a Rishi himself. Wow. So the rival we didn't just end there? Not at all. It transformed. They went from bitter enemies to, well, intense spiritual rivals, each pushing the other to greater heights of austerity and wisdom. And eventually. Eventually, according to tradition, they reached a state of mutual respect. Even collaboration on some hymns found in the Rigveda. It's a fascinating arc. So the conflict, the competition ultimately refined both of them. It's a hidden lesson in the text maybe. That rivalry can actually be a catalyst for growth. I think that's a perfect way to see it. It suggests that even intense opposition, if navigated through the lens of spiritual development, can lead to greater wisdom for everyone involved. Okay. So Vesishta triumphs over a mighty king using only spiritual force. He seems untouchable, right? You think so. But then we come to Sukta 7.86. And here he faces something far more intimidating than any army, which is his own potential failings in the eyes of Varuna. Ah, Varuna, we need to understand him properly to get the weight of this hymn. He's different from the other gods, isn't he? Very different. You know, Indra is loud. He throws thunderbolts. He's a warrior. Agni is the fire, immediate connecting heaven and earth. Rudra can be terrifying, wild, chaotic. But Varuna, Varuna watches. He's the silent observer. The omnipresent guardian of Gupta. Looked that's the key concept here, Cosmic Order. Exactly. But it's more than just the physical laws, like the sun rising or seasons changing, though it includes that. It's also the moral order. Truth, honesty, keeping oath, social harmony, the fundamental rightness of things. And Varuna enforces this side. He is its ultimate guardian. The texts say he knows everything. Every action, every word, every thought, every broken promise. Nothing is hidden from him. He sees the slightest deviation from this cosmic and moral law. That sounds deeply unsettling. The idea of a divine power scrutinizing your inner thoughts. It is. And that's why he's often depicted with the news, the Pasha. The news. What does that symbolize? It symbolizes inescapable consequences. He binds those who violate Tata, the liars, the oathbreakers, those who disrupt order. And this binding isn't just symbolic punishment after death. What was it then? In the Vedic understanding, it could manifest as a real world suffering. Illness, especially things like dropsy where the body swallows with fluid a literal binding, social ostracism, mental anguish. You are caught in Varuna's youth until you understand your transgression and repent. So he's a god of justice, but a very strict, almost terrifying one. Strict, yes, but also merciful. The other side is that he can release the bonds. He can forgive the truly repentant. There's compassion there, but it's a demanding compassion. Which brings us back to Vesysh this prayer. The agony comes from not knowing what he did wrong. That's the universal core of Suptus 7.86. It taps into that deep human fear, that anguish of suffering without knowing the cause. Vesysh that cries out, over, you know, what does my sin tell me? It's that feeling. Why is this happening? What did I do? Precisely. It's the weight of misfortune, sickness, bad luck, inner turmoil when you can't pinpoint the specific mistake you made. It could be something you did unknowingly, an unconscious violation of that complex cosmic order. So it acknowledges a fundamental human fallibility, not necessarily evil intent, but just ignorance. Exactly. That we can transgress simply by not understanding the full picture, the intricate web of cosmic law. Varuna's justice operates on that level too. And the only way out is this kind of raw, honest pleading we see from Vesyshtha. Which makes his confession incredibly powerful. Let's get into the words themselves. Suptus 7.86. Vesyshtha feels caught, bound by something, but he doesn't know what. What's his actual plea? It's incredibly direct, almost desperate. He asks, what is my seno, Varuna? Tell me, release me from my bonds. He wants diagnosis and cure all at once. But it goes beyond just his personal situation, doesn't it? It does very quickly. He broadens the scope. He says something like, unknowingly we wander in ignorance. Forgive us. It shifts from my sin to our condition. So it becomes a statement about humanity? Yes, it's arguably the Rigveda's first real articulation of a theology of human fallibility. The core problem is an intentional evil. It's not malice. It's a vidia, ignorance. It's error stemming from our limited human perspective. We break the cosmic rules. It's simply because we can't possibly grasp their full complexity. That's a profound insight. It changes the nature of sin and responsibility. It really does. And it makes the fact that Vesyshtha is saying this even more point in. Here's the wisest of the wise, admitting profound ignorance. If he doesn't know when he's transgressed, what hope is there for ordinary people? Well, the hymn suggests the answer isn't perfect knowledge, which might be impossible, but perfect humility. That's the next up he takes. He doesn't try to argue or list his good deeds. No justification at all. He simply submits. The text describes him bowing low. I salute you, Varuna. I fall before you. It's an act of complete surrender, seeking grace without even knowing the specific fault. It's humility, as you said, not humiliation. He's trying to realign himself with the cosmic order he respects, even if he doesn't fully understand it. Utifully put, he's appealing to Varuna's merciful aspect, hoping that the sincerity of his submission is enough. And how does the plea end? It ends with a plea for life itself. Take not our life of Varuna Sparras. It grounds the cosmic drama and the most basic human desire to continue to live. You can see why scholars call this one of the most moving prayers ever written. Absolutely. It strips away all the ritual layers, all the pride. It's just raw vulnerability, a direct plea from the limited human to the vast cosmic. And that feeling, it's timeless. It resonates regardless of culture or belief system. It gives a voice to that feeling of being lost and needing forgiveness for things unseen. Okay, so we've just been immersed in this incredibly deep, somewhat somber spiritual plea. Hold that thought, because Mundala 7 throws us a complete curve ball. It really does. It's one of the most delightful surprises in the entire Rigveda. Right alongside these profound hymns, you get Sukta 7.103, the frog hymn. The frog hymn. It sounds almost comical. And it is. It shows a totally different side of Beseesh the school. They clearly had a sense of humor. What's the scene it describes? Imagine a long hard drought. Everything is dry, dusty, silent. Then finally, the monsoon rains arrive. The land comes alive, pools form, and suddenly everywhere, frogs start croaking, loudly, all together. Okay, a common of sound after rain. But what did the Rishi see in it? They saw themselves, or rather a hilarious parody of their own activities. That was so. They compare the frogs croaking this loud chorus to Vedic priests chanting their hymns together. They say the frogs gather around the water like students around their teacher repeating the verses. Seriously, they're comparing frogs to priests and students. Effectionately, yes. There's even a line that compares their sound to the Somo Pressors, the priests preparing the sacred drink, who maybe got a bit loud and enthusiastic after sampling their work. They're literally teasing the frogs for sounding like slightly tipsy chanting priests. That's wonderful. It completely shatters the image of these ancient sages as only ever being deadly serious. They could laugh, they could see the funny side of life, even in nature mimicking their sacred duties. Exactly. It shows that joy, playfulness, even a bit of gentle satire, were part of their world, right alongside the deepest theological questions. It makes them so much more human, doesn't it? It really does. Is there more to it than just humor, though? Any deeper layer? I think so. If you look closely, the humor contains a subtle wisdom. Such as? Well, think about the frogs. They are silent all through the long drought. They wait patiently conserving energy. Then when the time is right, the rain they all burst forth together in community and perfect timing. Ah, so they're like little aesthetics themselves. Patience, timing, community action. Kind of. It's a lesson embedded in the laughter. Patience leads to expression. Silence precedes the chant. Drought gives way to abundance. It suggests that nature itself participates in the cosmic rhythm. That even the croaking of frogs can be seen as a form of natural vita. So, Sita, the cosmic order isn't just about Varunas judgment. It's also about the cycles, the joy, the unexpected lessons found everywhere. Precisely. It broadens the definition of the sacred. Laughter and wisdom can absolutely coexist. The frog, him, is proof. We've covered so much ground. Geography, war, confession, even humor. To wrap up our dive into Mandala 7, let's look forward. Where does all this lead philosophically? Well, the figure connecting it all in a way is Saraswati. Back to the river goddess. Back to her transformation. Remember, she becomes mother of rivers, mother of thoughts. She embodies the shift from physical sustenance to abstract knowledge. That very process of abstraction of finding deeper meaning behind the physical is the engine driving towards philosophy. And this leads Vassista's lineage towards what we now call Vedanta. The very earliest seeds of it, yes. Particularly, Advaita Vedanta, the philosophy of non-dualism, which becomes so central centuries later in the Upanishads. We find its first glimmers right here in Mandala 7, which is why you called it proto-Vedanta earlier, not just ritual, but nascent philosophy. Exactly. While most hymns focus on praising specific gods for specific boons, you start seeing hints that the sages were contemplating a deeper unity behind all these divine forms. Where does this show up? Is there a specific verse or idea? One example is in Sutta 7.33. Vassista is describing Agni, the fire god. But he uses terms like self-shining, immortal, radiant. He's attributing universal, eternal qualities to a specific deity. It suggests he's seeing Agni not just as fire, but as a manifestation of something more fundamental. Okay, that's subtle, but significant. Is there anything more explicit? There is. Though perhaps preserved more in the lineage's teachings than overtly and every hymn available to us now. It's the truly revolutionary whisper, the phrase that anticipates the Upanishads by centuries. The declaration, this self is Brahman, ayam-a-pma-bhrama. Wow, that's the core statement of Avada Vedanta, the identity of the individual soul at man with the ultimate reality Brahman. Precisely. And finding it associated with Vassista's time before the Manu Panashadik period is historically massive. It means these profound philosophical breakthroughs weren't sudden inventions. They evolved gradually within these Vedic schools. So even while performing rituals to many gods, they were already conceptualizing the one reality underlying everything. The evidence points that way. They were moving beyond just the how-to of ritual towards the what is of existence. The unity of consciousness was already being explored. So Mandala 7 really does give us the full spectrum. It absolutely does. You have the deep personal anguish of the confession to Varuna in 7186. You have the earthy humor and social observation of the frog hymn 7.103. And you have the startlingly early seeds of high philosophy, the unity expressed in 7.33 and related teachings. It's the whole human and spiritual experience. And this philosophical depth explains why Vassista remains such a key figure later on. Definitely. His teachings flow directly into texts like the Yoga Vassista, a major philosophical work where he's the main teacher instructing Rama on the nature of reality, consciousness, and liberation through understanding non-duality. Mandala 7 provides the roots for that later flowering of wisdom. Hashtag, tag, tag, outro. What an incredible journey through just one section of the Rigveda. Vassista's Mandala 7. We've seen its historical roots by the Saraswati, the drama of Topa's versus kingship, the profound weight of that confession to Varuna, the unexpected joy of the frog hymn, and these truly foundational whispers of Advaita. It really covers so much. And I think if there's one core lesson to take away from Vassista, perhaps reflecting on his whole story, the rivalry, the confession, the teaching, it's about what constitutes true greatness. Which is imperfection? Exactly. It's not about never making a mistake or never feeling doubt. It seems to be defined by the capacity for introspection, the courage to admit fault, even unknown fault. It's about the ability to find joy and humor, to learn from conflict, and ultimately to continually strive for that deeper understanding, that transcendence. That feels like the lasting message from the jewel of the Veda. That's beautifully put. So let's leave you, our listeners, with the final thought to chew on, building on all this. If Vassista, one of the wisest sages imaginable, filled compelled to apologize for sins he wasn't even aware of committing, what does that say about our own modern ideas of responsibility? How do we grapple with the potential consequences of actions or states of being that fall outside our conscious awareness, especially when measured against a concept like Varuna's all-encompassing cosmic order and awe? Something to think about. Until next time, on the Deep Dive.",
