  "text": "Welcome back to The Deep Dive. Today we are strapping in for something pretty unique, I think. We're going deep into just one single part of the Rigveda, mandala nine. Right, mandala nine. And it really stands out, doesn't it? You look at the other mandala's, the family books, they cover all sorts of gods, cosmology. Yeah, a whole mix, a bit of everything. A whole mix, but this one, all 114 hymns, they're dedicated to just one thing. One thing. It's kind of startling when you first encounter it. Soma Pavamana, the flowing Soma, purifying Soma. And that focus, I mean, an entire ancient book about a drink. It just grabs you, doesn't it? It really does. It's more than just curiosity, though. It points to this, well, you call it a Vedic obsession. Yeah, an obsession, because Soma, it's not just the liquid, right? It's presented as a god. It's the ritual itself. It's ecstasy, inside. All those things, drink God, ritual, the source of insight. It's multifaceted. So our mission today really is to explore this whole phenomenon, trace Soma from, you know, the plant being crushed. Right. The physical process, the very beginning. All the way to becoming this huge cosmic symbol, purification, immortality, the works. And it's such a fascinating piece of literature, too. Not just the focus, but the poetry itself, it's so rhythmic, almost soaring. These weren't just texts to be read quietly. No, how so? No, they were performed. Chanted aloud. It sounded like something specific, designed to, well, bring the ritual to life, synchronize everyone involved, mind and body. Okay. So we've kind of broken down the source material you shared into about seven main themes, yeah, to sort of track this journey. It's also a good plan, a logical flow. From the grinding, the physical stuff, all the way to these frankly wild claims about becoming a mortal. It's quite a ride. It takes you deep into the Vedic mindset. Right. It should be interesting. Let's get into it. Okay. So to really get Mandala 9, we need to like transport ourselves back, way back, maybe 1500 BCE. Roughly. Yes. Early Vedic period. And you have to picture the scene. It's probably early morning, right? There's this, this charged atmosphere, priests are gathering around the altar of the Vedic. And the main thing happening, the main sound is this grinding, constant grinding. That sound is absolutely crucial. The source is pretty clear. You have priests, the summer pressers, using actual stones. Right, stones to crush the stock. Exactly. Crushing these plant stocks against specially prepared wooden boards. It's not gentle, it's intense physical work, the core of the ritual action. And you can almost see it, right? This golden liquid starts to appear. Yes. The descriptions mentioned this golden shining juice flowing out. It froths up as it's maybe mixed with milk or water. And then filtering, not with like lab equipment, obviously. No, through something natural, find sheep's wool, usually, or maybe a sieve made of horse hair. It's strained carefully. And then poured into jars ready for, well, for the gods and for the priests themselves. For both. Yes. The offering and the consumption. And at him 9.1, the very first one, it just jumps right in. No preamble. What does it say? It's a command flow, summer. And they might pavasva, soma, mahe. It's immediate, forceful. Wow. Okay. So that really backs up what you said about performance. It's not a prayer about soma. It's talking to soma, telling it what to do is it's happening. Ritual theater. Precisely. It's full of sound, the crushing stones, the chanting specific actions. And this visual of the golden liquid emerging. Very dramatic, very sensory. Is that command style common in the rigveda? Or does this directness, this flow tell us something specific about this ritual? It suggests a very different priority. Many hymns describe gods. Or ask for things, you know, supplicate, agni for wealth or verunif for forgiveness. And all a nine is different. It's largely what scholars call liturgical poetry. Meaning it was part of the liturgy, the service itself. Exactly. Functionally vital. These hymns weren't recited before after the pressing. They were chanted during it. Synchronize with the actions. So the rhythm of the chant wasn't just like for mood music. It had to match the beat of the stones. That's the idea. If you look at the meters used Gayatri, Jigati, they're very rhythmic, often quite repetitive. Perfect for chanting along with a repetitive physical task like crushing. The rhythm of the verse matches the pounding. The flow of the chant perhaps matches the filtering. The whole hymn builds as the offering is prepared. The poem is the ritual in a way. It's like this immersive soundtrack guiding everyone, keeping them focused, ancient surround sound. You could put it that way. It is exactly that kind of synchronicity. The repetition, those insistent lines like flow, soma flow, povasa, povasa, they lock everyone's attention, priests, sponsors, everyone present. Turning a practical job, crushing a plant into something sacred, almost hypnotic. It elevates the effort into focus contention. It creates this deep shared focus, total engagement. And once you have that focus, once that golden liquid is ready, that's when things get really interesting. We move from the physical act to the, well, the really big claims. Because this wasn't just some energy drink they were making. This liquid, soma, was believed to hold the key to something much, much bigger. Immortality. Right. Nothing less. Yeah, this is where my mind kind of gets blown every time. In Mandala 9, soma isn't just, you know, offered to the gods. It is the divine essence. It's explicitly called omta. The nectar of immortality, the drink of the gods themselves. And the claim they make is just radical. Drinking it doesn't just please the gods. It makes you divine. It's a shortcut. It bypasses conceptually at least endless cycles of rebirth or accumulating merit. For the duration of the ritual's peak experience, the consumer becomes immortal transcends the mortal condition. There's a line you mentioned, him 9.113, the drop that leads us to the gods. Yes, it's seen as a vehicle, a literal transporter to the divine realm, or perhaps transforming the drinker into a god temporarily. Imagine the sheer conviction. These priests, the rishis, they've gone through this whole intense ritual, the chanting, the pressing, and they genuinely believe that this drink is the key, that they aren't just asking for immortality. They're tasting it, experiencing it directly. And the language is in subtle, is it? You said 9.113 is pretty explicit. Oh, incredibly explicit. There's no ambiguity. It's a declaration, almost a triumphant shout. We have drunk soma and become immortal. We have attained the light. We have found the gods. Apama, soma, abhuma, agama, yol tir, avidama, diva. Wow, just lays it right out there. It's a direct testimony of success. Total transcendence achieved. Which is why it's so fascinating for us looking back, right? Because what they call finding the gods or becoming immortal, we might try to understand that through different lenses today. Psychology maybe. Or even consciousness studies, altered states, we're essentially translating that experience. Yeah. Pure ecstasy described in the religious language available at the time. Yeah, that feeling of boundaries dissolving, seeing this intense light, feeling connected to everything. It maps very closely onto descriptions of peak experiences or altered states of consciousness across many cultures and contexts. Soma was understood as the doorway, the physical key that unlocked divinity, shattering those mundane mortal limits. A structured, ritual system designed not just to hope for transcendence, but to actively engineer it using rhythm, community, intention, and the string. Which brings us right back to the practical problem. If you want that result, that altered state, that feeling of divinity, what exactly is the ingredient? What plant could possibly do all that? And that, as you said, is the great mystery, the riddle that's hooked scholars for centuries. The biggest, most debated, still unsolved question in the whole rigveta, probably, what was soma? Okay, so let's get into the detective work, the search for the actual plant. Because the descriptions are so vivid, right? Golden, frothing gives you energy, visions, cosmic clarity. You think someone would have found it by now? You would think so. But the descriptions, while vivid, are also challenging. They set a very high bar, and maybe even a contradictory one for plants we know today. Oh, so contradictory. Well, it needs to be juicy, right? Like a stock you can crush and get a good amount of liquid from. That golden color is mentioned repeatedly. Okay, so not like a dry herb. Probably not. But then it also needs to be incredibly potent. It needs to induce these feelings of godhood, visions, immense energy, maybe even warrior frenzy, finding one plant that does all of that. Well, that's the issue. So what are the main suspects? I know there've been a few major theories. There have been many candidates over the years, but three tend to dominate the discussion. First, there's a fiedra. A fiedra, like the stimulant. Exactly. Certain species, particularly those found in central Asia where the indoeirions likely migrated from, fit some descriptions. It's a stalky, rush-like plant. You can crush it for juice, and chemically, it contains effigry. Which would definitely give you energy, make you feel powerful, maybe focused. Absolutely. It fits the energetic aspect, the pressing ritual. Yeah. But does it give you cosmic visions and make you feel like you become immortal? Probably not. It's more stimulant than psychedelic. Okay. So a fiedra, fins the physical process, but maybe not the full mental experience. What's next? The second big one is the fly agaric mushroom, eminina muscaria, proposed famously by Argordan Wassen. The red mushroom with white spots. That's the one. It's a powerful, hallucinogen. It definitely induces altered states, visions, feelings of transcendence that might match the finding the god's descriptions. Oh, it's a mushroom. How do you crush a mushroom like a stalk to get golden juice? And it's red and white, not golden. Precisely the problems. The physical description and the preparation method in the hymns just don't seem to fit a mushroom very well at all. Okay. So a fiedra fits the pressing, fly agaric fits the visions, but neither fits both. Any other major contenders. Cannabis comes up frequently. It can induce altered states, feelings of connection, maybe insight. But again, crushing stalks for juice doesn't really sound like how cannabis is usually prepared, resin leaves, maybe. Right. Again, a mismatch with the detailed ritual descriptions in Mendelinae. So no single plant we know today seems to be a perfect match for all the textual evidence, which leads to the big questions. Did the plant just die out? Climate change, maybe? Possible. Or did they just use so much of it for the rituals that they overharvested into extinction, especially if it only grew in a specific region? Also very possible. These are standard explanations offered. But there's another hypothesis, a more radical one, that shifts the focus entirely. Okay. What's that? What if Soma wasn't always the same exact plant? Wait, you mean they swapped ingredients. But wouldn't people notice? Wouldn't the effect be different? Why keep calling it Soma? That's the crux of it. The hypothesis suggests the concept of Soma, the divinal Xer, the purifier, the source of ecstasy, and the ritual for preparing it were the constants. As the Vedic people migrated over centuries, maybe they moved out of the range of the original plant, whatever it was. So they found local substitutes? They might have substituted other potent plants, maybe different aphidra species, maybe other psychoactive herbs we don't even know about, plans that could produce similar enough effects, whether stimulating or ecstasy inducing to fit the ritual's purpose. The powerful name Soma and the whole mythology around it, carried on, applied to whatever plant was ritually designated as the source of that power in that time and place. Huh. So Soma becomes less about a specific species and more about a specific function within the ritual, the ecstasy plant, whatever it happens to be locally. Kind of yes. It turns Soma from a lost species into a moving tradition, a symbol whose physical referent could change. That actually makes a lot of sense, especially for a tradition lasting millennia and covering vast geographical areas. And it helps explain the archaeology too, because what do we find at Indusurus Wadi sites potentially linked to these rituals? We don't find preserved Soma plants, which you might expect if it were common, or might not expect if it were rare or substituted. But we find. We find the tools, the pressing stones, sometimes with where patterns consistent with crushing stalks. We find filtering equipment, specialized pottery vessels that seem designed for preparing and serving a specific liquid. The ritual apparatus is there. The stage is set, even if the lead actor keeps changing costume or is missing entirely. A good analogy. The ritual performance, the structure, had incredible cultural staying power, leaving archaeological traces, even if the precise ingredient remains a mystery. Fascinating. So whether it was one lost plant or this moving tradition, the way they talked about it, the poetry, that's what truly gives Soma its enduring life. Absolutely. The language itself is incredibly powerful. And that brings us to the style of Mandala 9. It doesn't just talk about Soma, it feels different when you read it or hear it chanted. There's this insistence. Yes, a very noticeable feature is the heavy use of refrains, repeated phrases, repeated verbs. It creates this strong, almost hypnotic musicality. Built around that core phrase, we keep mentioning, flow, Soma, flow, Pavazva Soma. Exactly. It's constant. It drills the idea home. Compared to other mandalas, the poets here seem much more focused on creating something easily chantable, easily memorized, something that pulls a whole group into a shared rhythm. Like writing lyrics for a ritual song, almost? Very much so. Poetry designed to induce a state, not just describe one. Yeah. Collective trance through rhythm. And the metaphors they use to describe Soma, they're incredibly vivid, really powerful images, but sometimes, kind of contradictory. They can seem that way at first glance. What are the main ones you're thinking of? Well, you see Soma described as this mighty river, right? Sukta 9.67 compares it to a river rushing to the sea, flowing, cleansing, unstoppable movement, abundance. Yes, a very common and powerful image. Yes. Water flow purification makes perfect sense for a liquid being filtered. But then, just a bit later, in 9.97, Soma is called the roaring bull, the bringer of wealth, a bull. That's like the opposite of a river. It's solid, earthy, powerful, fertile, raw strength. Right, the bull, if a haze, a huge symbol of masculine power, potency, wealth, and cattle for the Vedic people. So how can it be both a liquid river and a solid bull? Is this just poets throwing out cool images or is there something deeper going on? I think it's definitely deeper. It's not a contradiction in the Vedic mindset. It's a synthesis. Soma isn't limited to one form or one type of power. Okay, so it embodies all these positive forces. Precisely. It is the essential life force, the cosmic energy. And that energy can manifest as cleansing flow and as potent strength. It represents purity, abundance, fertility, power, all at once. The poets are clothing this abstract energy in the most powerful, relatable images their audience knew. The life giving river, the wealth bringing bull. So it's not either it's both hand. Making the abstract power of Soma totally concrete and immediate for the listeners. Exactly. Making the feeling tangible through familiar potent symbols. And when you combine those powerful images with the driving rhythm, the refrains, you mentioned it feels like writing rhythm. That's a phrase used to describe it. Yeah, reciting these hymns, especially during the physical act of pressing, must have been an incredibly potent experience. Auditory, physical, mental, all working together to guide the participant towards that transcendent state they were seeking. A pathway built of words and rhythm. In this life force, this riverble energy, it wasn't just about power and ecstasy. It had a crucial moral dimension too. Write the purification aspect it cleanses. Yes, this is maybe Soma's most defining characteristic summed up in that key term. Pavamana. Pavamana, meaning the purifier or self purifying both really. It implies active purification flowing clear. Him 9.86 is explicit about this. And it's not just like washing dirt off your hands. No, it's deeper. It's spiritual cleansing. Absolutely. The hymns describe Soma washing away sins, faults, transgressions. The term used is inos. It cleanses moral impurity. Wow, but also physical cleansing, washing away fatigue, maybe illness. And crucially, clarifying and enlightening the mind, Pavamana cleanses on all levels. That's incredibly sophisticated for something from what 3,500 years ago. This idea that a ritual involving a specific substance could provide internal moral cleansing. It is humbling, isn't it? It shows a very developed understanding of the connection between ritual action, altered states and psychological well-being, a kind of spiritual technology. And you can definitely see the parallels with modern ideas, can't you? Oh, absolutely. Look at the whole process. The intense shared rhythm of chanting and pressing, the focused intention, the strong communal bonding, and then consuming this potent substance together. Sounds like therapy or catharsis. It functions very much like that. You could see Soma ritual as a form of ancient group therapy, maybe. A medicine, as some scholars put it, for guilt, for grief, for weariness, a way to achieve psychic relief and spiritual renewal. Therapy in a cup almost, designed to make you feel cleansed, renewed lighter. Exactly. The whole performance, the drinking and the chanting, is designed to trigger that feeling of purification, that release. And you mentioned something earlier about it actually changing the mind, like proto-neuroscience. Well, yes, some hymns use language that's incredibly suggested. They say Soma enters the Houdaya, which is usually translated as heart, but really means the core of consciousness, the seed of thought and emotion. Okay. And it rewires it. It clarifies thought, sharpen's insight. The key concept here is de-intervision, inspired thought, wisdom. So Soma doesn't just make you feel good. It makes you think better. Clear's the fog. That seems to be the claim. It cleanses the channels of perception and cognition, allowing the participants D to shine through, enabling that cosmic vision, that connection to the gods. It's presented as a fundamental upgrade for the mind and soul. That is some serious power packed into one drink, purifying sin, clarifying thought, maybe even restructuring the mind. Emense power. So immense in fact that even the king of the gods, the great warrior Indra is completely dependent on it. Ah, yes, the Indra connection. Right, the relationship between Soma and Indra is absolutely central to Vedic mythology. Indra is the big guy, the sky god, the dragon slayer, the one who keeps cosmic order. The ultimate warrior god, but he needs Soma, right? Desperately. He's consistently shown as Soma's number one consumer, maybe addict is too strong a word, but he craves it. The hymns often are prayers to Indra. Their commands for Indra drink, Indra drink, get strong. So the priests preparing Soma, they're essentially powering up the main god. The fate of the cosmos depends on them doing this ritual correctly. That's exactly the implication. The mythology spells it out. Indra drinks the Soma, gets filled with this divine energy, this battle fury, and then he can fight Retra. Then he slays Retra, the serpent or dragon holding back the waters of the sky. By killing Retra, Indra releases the reins, ensures fertility, restores cosmic balance. Soma's the fuel for that victory. Divine jet fuel you could say. Okay, that makes sense, but you said Mandala 9 is something different with this relationship. It shifts the focus. It really does. In many other hymns, Indra is clearly the hero, the main character. Soma is important, but secondary it's the means to Indra's end. And Mandala 9, though, across these 114 hymns, Soma takes center stage. Soma becomes the true hero. He's praised in his own right universally. He's the divine priest guiding the ritual, the healer purifying the mind, Pavamana, the source of inspiration, the key, the warrior giving interest strength, the friend bringing joy. The argument implicitly made is that everyone needs Soma. Even the gods, especially the gods. Okay, I see. So Indra becomes less the star and more the prime customer. Pretty much. Which leads to this amazing paradox at the heart of the whole Vedic ritual system. Think about it. The most powerful substance in the universe, the nectar of immortality, the drink the gods need is made by humans is made by human priests, the rishis, they press it, they filter it, they chant over it, they control this preparation and offering. Whoa. Okay, that really does slip things, doesn't it? Man brews, god drinks. It completely changes the power dynamic you might expect. This isn't just humans humbly begging gods for favors. This is ritual as collaboration, maybe even codependency. Humans aren't just passive worshipers. They are active participants, essential partners in maintaining cosmic order. Exactly. They hold the key. They provide the divine energy source. It grants the human ritualists incredible agency, incredible importance in the cosmic scheme. They're not just praying for rain. They're brewing the stuff that enables the god to make it rain. You could even see it as a kind of division of cosmic labor. Soma, produced by the insightful rishis, represents the inspiration, the plan, the dees. Indra represents the executive power, the strength needed to carry it out. You need both brain and brawn. And the humans are providing the brain fuel. That's quite a statement about the importance of human ritual action. It elevates the ritual from mere supplication to a necessary cosmic partnership. But then as we discussed, the plant, the physical basis for all this, it gets lost or changes or fades into mystery, leaving behind this incredibly potent legacy, this symbol. A symbol that still resonates even today. Yeah, it's clear Soma the plant is lost to us really. We can't definitively point to it. But Soma the idea of the archetype, that seems very much alive. It absolutely survives. It taps into that fundamental human longing for something more, for ecstasy, for connection, for clarity, for transcendence. You see echoes of it everywhere. Don't you? When you think about it. Really do. Think about any ritualized sharing of drink, meant to elevate mood or mark an occasion, a toasted a wedding, raising a glass. Sharing drinks at a festival, trying to capture that collective joy. Even that quiet cup of tea or coffee, first thing in the morning, seeking focus and clarity to start the day. These are all, in a way, faint cultural echoes of that original impulse embodied by Soma. Using a shared substance, often ritually prepared or consumed to achieve a desired interstate, be it joy, connection, or focus. Soma becomes the ultimate symbol for that quest. The light that purifies the joy that lifts. It represents that inexhaustible source of inner energy, the potential for transcendence that humans seem to always be seeking one way or another. And looking back with our modern understanding, scholars see more than just mythology here, right? They see proto-science. Very much so. Mendel and I is a fascinating case study in what you might call ancient proto-chemistry, the careful manipulation of plant substances combined with sophisticated proto-psychology. Engineering altered states. Precisely. It shows how deliberately ancient cultures could design rituals, using specific elements, rhythm, chanting, community, focused intention, and yes, psychoactive substances to reliably induce profound shifts in consciousness for spiritual purposes. It wasn't just about getting high, it was transcendence by design. Exactly. And perhaps the deepest philosophical takeaway from Adalinaian woven through all that ecstatic poetry is about the nature of immortality itself. That's the lesson there. The true immortality, the kind achievable by humans, isn't about cheating biological death. That's reserved for the gods, or maybe just fantasy. Instead, it's found in those peak moments of shared experience. Ah, that we have found the gods moment. Yes. That collective ritualized feeling of touching the divine, finding the light, becoming one with the cosmos, even if just for a short time during the ritual. That shared transcendence is the taste of immortality available to us. That's a really powerful way to frame it. Mixed Mandala 9, not just about a drink, but about the human potential for shared peak experience. Which is why it's arguably the Vedas most musical, most ecstatic, and perhaps most psychologically profound book. It celebrates a process, a state of mind, and then eternal quest for interlight. Wow. Okay. That was quite the deep dive into just one book of the Rigveda. Mandala 9, the Soma Mandala. We went from the actual physical grinding of the plant stock. Imagining that sound and smell. Through the whole mystery of what the plant even was, the aphadra, the mushrooms, the moving tradition idea, seghali debates, then into Soma as this purifier, this ancient therapy, maybe even restructuring the mind. The Pabamana aspect. And finally, that wild relationship with Indra, flipping the hierarchy, man brewing for the gods. It really covers a lot of ground, showing just how central this whole Soma complex was to the early Vedic worldview. Absolutely. If you want a shortcut into understanding that intense focus on ritual, on engineered spiritual states, on achieving a Mada, Mandala 9 is kind of the key, isn't it? It truly is. It lays bare that core obsession, that driving force in a way no other part of the Vedas does quite so singularly. So as we wrap up, we always like to leave you, the listener, was something to chew on. A final thought inspired by our dive. Right. And building on that idea of immortality being found in shared moments. Here's something to consider. If these ancient people thousands of years ago developed such sophisticated techniques using rhythm, ritual, community, psychoactive substances to consistently engineer these profound shared moments of transcendence. Yeah. Moments they felt were tastes of immortality, finding the light. Yeah. What does that tell us about our own modern quest for joy, for meaning, for genuine connection? Especially when somebody of our own daily rituals feel, well, maybe more isolating or technologically mediated or less intentionally focused on shared transcendence. That's a heavy question. It makes you wonder, doesn't it? What are we consuming? Literally and metaphorically. What rituals are we performing individually and collectively? And are they actually bringing us closer to that feeling of light, that deep connection, that sense of shared immortality that the Vedic poets seem so obsessed with capturing? Something to definitely think about. What are our modern somas and are they working? A question for another time perhaps. Indeed. Thanks for joining us on The Deep Dive.",
