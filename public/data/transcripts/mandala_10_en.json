  "text": "Welcome back to the Deep Dive. Today we are undertaking quite a journey. We're heading to the very end of one of humanity's oldest surviving religious texts. We are navigating Mandala 10, the grand finale of the Rigveda. And it's fascinating because this ending, it isn't quite just an ending. It feels more like a radical act of synthesis, maybe even a new beginning in some ways. We're closing the book, but this final chapter, which seems to be composed later than the rest, it sort of replaces those ritual answers we saw earlier with these big philosophical questions. The whole atmosphere just shifts. Right, from that focus sacrifice to this really sweeping profound introspection. Exactly. And that's the core paradox we really need to dig into today. Our mission, if you will, is to extract the heart of what some call the most human Mandala. It seems to abandon the maybe meter categories of the earlier books and just embraces the whole messy, beautiful, difficult experience of being human. We're talking about everything, cosmic creation, the structural society, how they handle death with funeral rights. But also really grounded stuff too, like the pain of addiction. And then there's this incredible philosophical declaration of, well, ignorance really, that still feels challenging today. Absolutely. And the centerpiece, the undisputed star of this whole final collection has to be the Natsudeya Sukta. That's him 10.129. I mean, this is the ultimate philosophical mic drop, as you put it. It puts forward an idea that's just so astonishing and yet so humbling. It basically redefines the whole text by suggesting the possibility that, you know, when you're facing the ultimate mystery of where everything came from. Maybe even the gods don't know. Precisely. Maybe even they don't know. Wow. That level of radical humility, that willingness to end this foundational scripture of a whole civilization, not with certainty, but with doubt, with wonder. That's what we really need to explore. And the sheer diversity of the material preserved here is just staggering. It shows the ancient ritchies, the seers. They believe profound truth could be found, well, everywhere. From the highest heavens contemplating creation. Right down to the shame and despair found in a gambling hall. Yeah. So to really get a handle on Mendoza 10, we first have to talk about its structure. It's a bit of an anomaly. It has 191 hymns, which makes it one of the largest books comparable in size to Mendoza 1. Okay. So it's big. It's big. Yeah. But historical analysis, linguistic clues, they all suggest that a lot of the content in Mendoza 10 was actually composed significantly later. Then those core family, mandalas, you know, books two through seven. Those ones are very focused on specific priestly families and their ritual needs. Oh, right. So if those central books are like the established ritualistic heart of the Vedic tradition, then Mendoza 10 is more like the intellectual frontier, or maybe the social frontier, where the traditions started looking back at itself experimenting a bit. That's a great way to put it. It's where they began to reflect to integrate new philosophical ideas, new social concerns that must have popped up over generations. So it's less rigid, maybe? Exactly. Commentaries often describe it as a kind of literary patchwork. It's less focused on ticking boxes for specific gods or sacrifice formulas. It seems more interested in pulling together these broader themes of what it means to be human, how the cosmos works, and that openness that led to including hymns from a much wider circle of rishis. Including women, right? You mentioned that earlier. Critically, including women's seers. Yes. And that diversity, having all these different voices, it definitely fueled the experimental feel of the compositions. You get things here you just don't find elsewhere. Which I think is why people call it the most human mandala of all. It really is like an intellectual curiosity cabinet. You've got these towering abstractions like the three key hymns on creation 10.129, 10.121, 10.9's are huge concepts. But then sitting right next to them are these intensely practical, deeply felt human concerns. The range is just breathtaking. I mean, beyond cosmology, you get detailed descriptions of death. The earliest, really systematic account of funeral rights we have is in 10.1 through 18. So the very practical concern of, okay, what do we do now? How do we guide the soul? Exactly. That gets enshrined right there. And you mentioned the unique voices. It wasn't just abstract philosophy or ritual. The hymns by women's seers, like you said, 10.125, the devi sukta. Electrifying. Yeah. And insights in 10.39. These aren't just little side notes. Are they? They feel central. Oh, absolutely central. They offer these powerful philosophical statements from a distinctly feminine perspective. It's remarkable they're preserved so prominently. And this editorial choice to kind of throw everything in together. Yeah, this patchwork idea. It really underlines the Vedas ability or maybe it's ambition to document life completely. And the most striking example of that, the one that really catches you off guard. Has to be the gambler's lament. Him 10.34. Right. It's this raw, unvarnished story of a guy basically weeping over his gambling addiction, his shame, his regret. And it's placed right alongside him's calling to the highest gods. It's unexpected. It really is. Yeah. It shows people thousands of years ago were grappling with the exact same kinds of struggles. The same self destructive patterns, the same family problems that we see today. Addiction, shame, regret. It makes it incredibly relatable. It's this amazing preservation of just grounded human pain. It confirms this isn't just a sacred text in some abstract sense. It's a document of the human condition full stop. But okay, from this incredible breath, we really need to pivot now. We need to tackle that overarching existential mystery that clearly preoccupy the ancient mind. And it's a mystery that Mandala 10 dives into head on. Where the universe actually come from. So it's pretty striking isn't it? And what becomes a foundational text for so many, the Rishis didn't just settle on one single authoritative creation story. Instead, Mandala 10 gives us three quite distinct visions. Why do that? Why the need for like a triple narrative? Well, the very existence of these three Hiranya Garbapuruja and Nassadiya, it signals a real intellectual maturity, I think. It suggests that you realize that the mystery itself, origin of everything, is just so immense, so foundational, that no single human idea, no single metaphor, could possibly contain it all. So it's like an active demonstration of embracing multiple truths, not seeing them as contradictory necessarily. That's how many sources interpret it. Yes. Saying here are different ways to approach the unapproachable. Okay, let's break them down. The first one, Hiranya Garbapuja, him 10.121. This one seems to ground creation in a single point, right? The golden embryo. The Hiranya Garbapuja concept is really evocative. Imagine this cosmic egg, or maybe a golden fetus, just suspended, floating in these primordial undifferentiated waters. See the pure latency. Okay. And then from this single shining seed, this golden embryo, all of creation kind of hatches, it unfolds. It implies this gradual expansion from an initial singular contained source of energy. You know, when you describe it like that, it sounds remarkably similar to some modern cosmological ideas. The sources even point out it's like a big bang and egg form. And it's probably not a direct correspondence, obviously. But it highlights how the ancient imagination and modern science, using vastly different languages and tools, sometimes seem to, well, rhyme when they confront that ultimate beginning. Approaching the same singularity with different toolkits. Exactly. Now the second narrative is incredibly famous. And it's had a huge historical impact, not always positive, that's the Purusha Sukta, him 10.9, the vision of the cosmic man. Right. This one is less about physics and more about, well, society and how things fit together. Precisely. It's framed as a cosmic ritual. The God sacrificed this primal being Purusha. And his body is dismembered and the parts become the universe, the sun, the moon, the atmosphere. And crucially, human society itself. This is where the different social orders originate according to the hymn. Yes. And this is where we absolutely must be careful with interpretation. The hymn uses this explicit anatomical metaphor. The mouth of Purusha becomes the brahmins, the priests, the keepers of knowledge. The arms become the kushatriya's warrior rulers, the thighs, the vishis, merchants, farmers, and the feet become the sudras, the laborers, the support structure. Now the sources are really clear that this description is foundational. But they also stress that the original intent of this metaphor might have been very different from the rigid hierarchy it later supported. Absolutely. Critical distinction. The original vision, as much as we can reconstruct it from historical analysis, seems to portray society as a single unified body. An interdependent organism. Like a real body. Like a real body. Think about it. The mouth representing knowledge or speech is useless without the feet providing support and movement. The arms for action need the belly, maybe representing sustenance from the vishis. Every single part was vital. Each fulfilled an essential complementary function for the whole thing to work to thrive. It was likely intended as a holistic vision of necessary cooperation. That makes so much sense. So it was a sociological framework based on everyone needing everyone else. That then tragically over centuries got misused, hardened into the rigid social hierarchy, the caste system that we recognize historically. The metaphor got frozen, losing its original fluidity and sense of like equal importance through necessity. It's a really powerful and sobering lesson in how sacred metaphors can be interpreted or misinterpreted and then applied historically with profound consequences. But even these two huge visions, the cosmic egg and the cosmic man, even they weren't the final word in mandala 10, the rishis pushed even further right to the edge of comprehension, which brings us to the third and arguably the most radical vision of all. The Nasa Dia Sutta. Ah, yes, the one that starts by basically denying the premise of the other two. Exactly. Kicks off with pure paradox. There was neither non-existence nor existence then. Okay, so now we have to dive into what might be the greatest expression of philosophical uncertainty in the entire rigveta. It's honestly stunning when you realize that this incredibly dense, almost impenetrable philosophical text, one that demands your full mental focus, it's just seven verses long. The philosophical power is incredibly concentrated and it works through negation, through stripping way concepts. The hymn starts by just systematically dismantling every single concept we use to describe reality. No, none existing. No, an existence, no existence. Okay, right there, our basic logic is gone. Yeah, that's already mind bending. Then no space, no sky, then no death, no immortality. It's defining that primordial state purely by what it wasn't, by what it lacked. So it's describing a void, but it's somehow beyond just emptiness. If there was no death, then there couldn't been life as we know it. If there was no existence, there wasn't even non-existence to contrast it with. It feels like they were grappling with the state of pure, undifferentiated potential. A reality completely beyond the dualities we used to make sense of things. Precisely. A pre-dualistic state. And this is where, again, you hear these echoes, these resonances with modern physics. The moment the hymn talks about a state where a space in sky and therefore space time did not exist, well, conceptually they're nudging up against the same boundary that scientists hit when they talk about the insta before the big bang, before the universe began expanding. A reality that precedes the known laws of physics. In a sense, yes. They're recognizing that limit through philosophical introspection. Okay, so if there was absolutely nothing, as we understand it, no matter no spirit, no gods, no laws, how did the universe possibly move from that absolute stasis into, well, into being? The hymn gives an answer, but it feels more psychological than theological. It does. It introduces this concept of comma, which is usually translated as desire or maybe longing. And the hymn calls comma the first seed of mind. The first seed of mind, desire. Yes. This desire isn't necessarily directed at anything yet. It's the initial impulse, the very first flicker, a kind of spontaneous psychological stirring that breaks the perfect silence, the perfect equilibrium of that undifferentiated reality. That's profound. It suggests creation wasn't just like an accident or some deity deciding, let there be light. It was a primordial metaphysical want. The universe began because on some fundamental level, it desired to exist. It's an incredibly poetic and deeply psychological explanation for that very first moment of instability, that symmetry breaking. It really contrasts with systems where creation is purely the result of a divine blueprint or just physical stuff clumping together. It does. The rishi seemed to attribute the ultimate origin not to pure logic or mechanics, but to longing. It's almost like the spontaneous quantum fluctuation of consciousness itself. And as the analysis often suggests, whether you call that initial impulse comma or you call it a quantum field excitation, maybe we're just using two different languages to approach the very same mystery. But the real kicker. The reason this hymn stands out so much, why it gets labeled as one of the earliest examples of philosophical agnosticism, it comes right at the end. After all this deep speculation, the text is shimmed. Doesn't claim to know the answer. No, quite the opposite. It delivers the definitive question. The absolute peak of humility in the text, it asks, who truly knows? Who can hear declared? Whence was it born? Whence this creation? And then the final lines, the gods came afterwards with the creation of this universe. Who then knows whence it has arisen? He, the first origin of this creation, whether he formed it all or did not form it, whose eye controls this world in highest heaven, he verily knows it, or perhaps he knows not. Or perhaps he knows not. That's the line. That's the moment that just has to make you pause and think. Here you have this ancient text, the foundation of a major religious tradition, and it explicitly says the ultimate mystery might be unknowable, even to the highest being, the one overseeing creation. Was this kind of institutionalized doubt common back then, or is this level of humility really unique to the Rigveda? Well, commentary suggests that compared to other foundational religious texts from around that time, this degree of open-ended self-critical doubt is remarkably rare. It really sets a tone for intellectual freedom. It's not denying the divine, is it? Not at all. It's more like a declaration of the absolute limit of human knowledge, and perhaps even divine knowledge when it comes to the ultimate origin. It enshrines humility as maybe the highest intellectual virtue. By posing the question so starkly, the Vedas essentially encouraging the next generation of thinkers to keep searching, keep questioning, rather than just settling for dogma. That's incredibly powerful, and for you, our listener, who's absorbing the weight of these ancient complex ideas, have practical thought. We've been talking about the immense philosophical weight packed into those seven short verses hem 10.129. If you actually check your resources, maybe navigate to mandala 10 in the material we've provided, or find a good translation of the Nassadiya Sukta online, and just read it. Experience those negations, feel that final question for yourself. It really transforms it. It goes from being an academic point to a genuine, what moment? Reading those lines of pure paradox is definitely an experience in itself. It forces you to confront the limits of language and thought. If creation itself begins with this profound doubt, this quiet longing, well, the very next expression of power we encounter in mandala 10 is anything but quiet. It's loud, it's certain, it's a declaration from agatus. We pivot completely from the ultimate uncertainty to absolute undeniable certainty in him 10.125. This is the Devi Sukta, the hymn of the goddess. And the whole text is delivered as this, frankly, electrifying monologue by Vahak, the goddess of speech herself. It's a tremendous statement of divine empowerment, and it feels like a re-centering of power within the cosmos. Vahak doesn't, you know, ask nicely for respect. She declares her fundamental sovereignty. Her role is the power behind the whole cosmic show. She really doesn't mince words, does she? She basically says, I move with the Rudras, the Vasus, all the big name gods, I sustain the very beings you worship. It's almost like she's telling the established male pantheon, look, you guys function because I allow it without me, without speech, you're powerless. It's a complete philosophical manifesto packed into a hymn. She claims the highest titles for herself. I am the sovereign queen, the gatherer of treasures, the first one who should be worshipped. And the philosophical point underpinning it all is just crucial. Speech, Vahak, is the foundational structure of reality. Without the ability to articulate to name things, to utter the sacred mantras, to conduct the rituals, to transmit knowledge, there's no ordered universe. Speech creates and sustains order itself. But the really revolutionary context here, the detail we absolutely cannot overlook and which the research strongly emphasizes, it's the authorship. Oh yes. This incredible declaration of divine feminine power, it was composed by Vahak Ambreeni, a woman's seer, a female Rishi. And that fact just reverberates across 3,000 years. This isn't just a goddess speaking through a male priest channeling her voice. This is a profound theological insight, composed and delivered by a woman's seer, and accepted into the canonical heart of the Raveda. It stands as powerful evidence that profound spiritual and philosophical insight was recognized and thankfully preserved as coming from women in the Vedic age. Vahak Ambreeni's voice defines supreme power right here in Mandala Ten. Okay. So from that absolute high point divine feminine power, the foundation of reality and speech, we now take a dramatic tumble. We go right down to the deepest trough of human weakness, human despair. The editorial whiplash in Mandala Ten is pretty intense, but necessary it seems. In conclusion, in 10.34, this is maybe what makes Mandala Ten feel so intensely relatable, so grounded, it's almost unbelievable editorial decision, isn't it? To place this heart-wrenching account of a man basically weeping over losing a dice right next to the ultimate creation mystery and the manifesto of the sovereign queen of the universe. Yeah. Imagine the scene it preserves. This guy completely ruined by his addiction, totally fixated on the dice. He even personifies them, calls them deceptive, captivating, but utterly destructive. This isn't grand mythology, it's like a raw psychological case study of addiction written thousands of years ago. And the confession itself is just brutal. It's immediate, it captures the social collapse, the family breakdown that addiction causes. He cries out his shame, his despair. My wife despises me, my mother-in-law hates me, he talks about being ruined, losing everything, having no status left. I find no one to pity me. It's so fascinating to me, it's just the decision to document this kind of everyday suffering. It feels like it validates the lived pain of just an ordinary person. It shows the compilers of the Veda whoever they were, they didn't think the sacred space had to exclude the messy, the shameful, the non-heroic reality of human life, the shame, the debt, the family arguments, it's all right there. It really grounds the entire Veda, doesn't it? It makes the text feel comprehensive. If it only spoke about God's creation, it would feel incomplete somehow. By including the gambler's lament, the text achieves this incredible holistic documentation of the human condition. It makes it relatable to anyone who's ever struggled with a compulsion, with self-destructive desire. And the hymn doesn't just describe the suffering, it ends, having laid it all bare, with this desperate plea that sounds like it comes straight from bitter experience. A direct moral warning. The messages blunt, do not play with dice. No, cultivate your farmland, enjoy the property you have, thinking highly of it. And then referring to the gambler, your cattle, a gambler, and your wife also, it's a stark warning. They burn like fire, he says of the dice. Tend your farm, live honestly, be content. It's such practical advice born from such deep pain. It's the ultimate anti-climax after the high philosophy maybe, and yet somehow it feels perfect in this collection. Okay, so from the fiery self-inflicted pain of dice addiction, we need to turn our attention now to the ultimate transition, the journey from this life into whatever comes next. And mandala 10 handles this with real ritualistic care. So as we get toward the very end of mandala 10, the final hymns, we find some of the oldest, most detailed descriptions we have of funeral rights. And the earliest really clear visions of an afterlife in the rigveta, these are in hymns 10.14 through 10.1 teen. And they seem to lay to groundwork for a lot of later traditions, right? They absolutely do. Central to this whole section is the figure of Yama. Now, unlike maybe the later perception of Yama as this fearsome judge of the dead, here in the rigveta, he's introduced in a much more comforting role. He was the very first mortal to die. The first one to make the journey. Exactly. By dying first, Yama basically charted the path. He found the way from the world of living to the world of the departed. So because he successfully crossed over, he becomes the guide, the Lord of the departed, showing others the way. That's the idea presented here. The prayers in these hymns are actually quite warm, almost welcoming. They urged the soul of the person who has just died to follow the path that Yama forged. You see these invocations like, go forth, go forth upon the paths of old by which our fathers passed beyond. And addressing Yama, lead us to the fathers Yama. Let us join our ancestors. So that establishes a pretty firm early Vedic belief in an afterlife. The soul goes somewhere specific. Yes, it journeys to Patloka. Literally the realm of the fathers, the realm of the ancestors. It's pictured as a place of rest, of continuity, a kind of gathering place for everyone who has gone before. It ensures the soul's existence carries on beyond the physical body. And this seems to be a theme in Mandala Ten. There are complexities here too. Within these same funeral hymns, we find what look like the first subtle hints, the first seeds of what would later become this huge philosophical shift of finding Indian thought. The idea of repeated existence, samsara. Indeed, it's fascinating. While the primary picture is this journey to a final destination, Patloka joining the ancestors. Some verses start to suggest something else. They hint at punanipur, which literally means redeth or repeated death. There are references that imply the soul might be born again and again. It suggests death might not be the absolute final endpoint, but maybe a transition point in a much larger cycle. Wow. So this is the critical philosophical evolution happening right here within Mandala Ten itself. It's moving, or maybe beginning to move, from a relatively straightforward idea of go join the ancestors to the much more complex concept of eternal cycles of birth, death and rebirth. It seems to be laying the intellectual groundwork for what blossoms later in the Upanishads and subsequent religious developments. The potential for reincarnation is being introduced. And the practical details of the funeral rights, themselves, seem to reflect this understanding of transition, of movement. They do. The ritual focus is clearly on cremation. Agni, the god of fire, who in earlier mandalas is the key messenger carrying sacrifices up to the gods. He gets repurposed here. In the funeral context, if a fire isn't just about destruction, Agni becomes the essential vehicle for the soul's journey after death. The idea is that the smoke from the funeral pyre acts as the literal pathway, carrying the non-physical essence of the departed soul upwards towards the heavens towards Yama, towards that realm of the ancestors. So it closes the loop that mandalas had started, from the unknowable origin of creation itself. Through the messy, glorious, painful experience of life, captured in things like the gambler's lament, to this final transition, guided by Yama, carried by Agni, and maybe heading towards a start of a new recurring cycle. Yeah. Hashtag tag outro. And so mandalatem brings the rigvada to its conclusion, but not it seems by providing rigid, final answers. Instead, it courageously opens up this whole horizon of questions. We've really traversed the entire spectrum of human experience in this one book, the awe and mystery of origin, in the Nassadia Sukta. The vision of social interdependence in the parusha him. The absolute sovereignty declared by Valkyem Breene. The raw, relatable despair of the gambler's lament. And finally, charting the soul's journey into Pitheloka, but also planting those first seeds of rebirth, it covers so much ground. This final mandala, ultimately, it feels like an invitation, an invitation to keep wondering, to practice intellectual humility, and to just continue seeking knowledge. It's enduring power, I think, lies in its capacity to hold paradox. To speak of the highest divinity while also acknowledging the depths of human weakness. And most importantly, to accept the inherent limits of what we can know. The message feels clear. Truth is vast, perspectives are many, and maybe doubt itself a sacred. And that ultimate philosophical legacy, the kind of whisper that closes this incredible 3000 year old collection. It's summed up in that simple, profound phrase that really captures the tolerant, maybe syncretic nature of the Vedic tradition. It comes sad vi prbahu to vedant. Truth is one, the wise speak of in many ways. That tolerance for multiple truths, that embrace of different perspectives, coupled with that radical intellectual humility, that's the profound gift Mandela Ten leaves you the listener with. So as you move forward from this deep dive, reflecting on the sheer depth and breadth of the Rigveda from those fiery sacrifices in the early books right through to the philosophical introspection, and even the self-doubt of this final one, here's a final provocative thought for you to consider. How can this ancient encouragement, this 3000 year old nudge, to embrace doubt, to honor multiple, even conflicting truths? How can that help us navigate today's world? A world where we're constantly bombarded with information, with competing perspectives, often delivered with absolute, unyielding certainty? Maybe let the spirit of Mandela Ten empower you a little. Let the Vedas live not just as a historical record locked away in books, but perhaps in your own courage to question absolute certainty when you encounter it. In your willingness to hold paradox, to accept complexity, and maybe just maybe, in your reverence for knowledge itself, even, or perhaps especially, when that knowledge reveals the exciting, open-ended limits of what can ever be truly known.",
